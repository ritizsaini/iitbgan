Our earlier work here mostly targeted next-generation (silicon/germanium based) logic/memory transistor technologies. These days, it is oriented more towards wide-bandgap material (e.g. GaN, SiC) based transistors for high-speed and high-power applications. Our interest has been to connect materials modeling to device design, and device design to circuit simulation. We use a combination of commercial simulation tools as well as simple tools developed in-house (e.g. MATLAB based, especially for aspects of device modeling). The overarching goal here is to relate emerging physical effects at the material or device level to their circuit-level impact.
